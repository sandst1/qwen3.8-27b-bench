"""Feed loading.

Feeds are JSON documents. Remote feeds are fetched over HTTP; local ones
(used in development and in the fixtures/ directory) are read from disk.

The three providers we currently pull from do not agree on much, so this
module normalises them into a common item shape:

    {"title": str, "link": str, "summary": str, "published": str,
     "source": str, "raw_id": str}

`raw_id` is always populated and is chosen, per format, to be whatever value
is *actually* stable across re-fetches of the same logical item — that is
not always the provider's own "id" field. It is the dedup key `store.py`
uses to decide whether an item has already been notified on. See the
per-format comments below for why each choice was made.
